#Also conditionals
x = int(input("What's x? "))
y = int(input("What's y? "))

if x < y:
    print("x is less than y")

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")

if x == y:
    print("x is equal to y")

#Ahora usando elif
a = int(input("What's a? "))
b = int(input("What's b? "))

if a < b:
    print("a is less than b")

elif a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")

elif a == b:
    print("a is equal to b")
